Deduction
---------

The main idea behind logic programming is that deduction (i.e. the construction of logical consequences) can be viewed as a form of computation, 
and that the declarative statement of the form

Prolog program define what is what? not how.

P if Q and R and S

can also be interpreted procedurally as:

To solve P, solve Q and R and S.

A logic database is comprised of a set of facts and rules. Facts can define relations just as in relational databases.


Queries can always be interpreted as goals: 
Instead of asking "Is there an X such that parent(silvia,X) is true?"  
we can also put it imperatively: "Try to find an X such that you can prove parent(silvia,X)!". 
Therefore, we shall use the terms "query" and "goal" interchangeably.

Facts and rules are collectively called Horn clauses, or clauses, for short. 
It should be noted that a fact is just a special case of a rule, the case where n = 0. 
If a relation is declared with more than one clause, these clauses are to be considered as alternatives.

Prolog = Predicate Logic
------------------------------------------------------

Prolog - used in following problems
1) Natural language processing
2) Grammars (Programming language grammar)
3) Theorem proving
4) Expert System and AI.
